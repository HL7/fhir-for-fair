### Overview

[<span class="underline">FAIR4Health</span>](https://www.fair4health.eu/)
is a project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020. It is carried
out by 17 partners from 11 different countries and lasts 36 months,
bringing together expertise from different domains (health research,
data managers, medical informatics, software developers, standards and
lawyers).

The overall objective of FAIR4Health is to facilitate and encourage the
European Union **health** research community to **FAIRify**, that is, to
augment, share and reuse datasets derived from publicly funded research
initiatives, demonstrating the FAIR strategy’s potential impact on
health outcomes and health research. It focuses on two main use cases:

> 1\. FAIR4Health Pathfinder Use case 1 (P1): to support the discovery
> of disease onset triggers and disease association patterns in comorbid
> patients and demonstrate the reproducibility of research
> 
> 2\. FAIR4Health Pathfinder Use case 2 (P2): to develop and pilot a
> prediction service for 30-days readmission risk in patients with COPD

This project has developed an intuitive, user-centered **technological
platform** to enable the translation from raw (meta)data to FAIR
(meta)data and the sharing of this information.

Raw data extracted from real healthcare institution EHRs across Europe,
are FAIRified and converted to HL7 FHIR resources complying to a common
data model.

The studies are made accessible through the FAIR4Health portal
([<span class="underline">https://portal.fair4health.eu/</span>](https://portal.fair4health.eu/))
describing the covered use case, the number of patients involved and the
number of contributing sites. Computable metadata concerning the health
data sets published by each site is also given.

Published health datasets cannot be accessed directly, but they can be
reused by authorized researchers in the context of specific use cases
through algorithmic access via FAIR4Health Agent.

### Using HL7 FHIR

The raw healthcare data considered for the purpose of the project at the
subject level have been:

  - Data related to patients (pseudoanonimized identifier, gender, age,
    country,...)

  - Information from encounters of these patients: identifier, start and
    end date, type of encounter (planned vs unplanned), ICD-10 codes,
    drugs prescription at discharge (identifier, code).

  - Specific observations, such as: smoking status, institutionalized
    status, mortality status, domiciliary oxygen prescribed, result of
    the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale.

  - Results of laboratory tests: identifier, code, quantity, unit, date.

data that have been represented in HL7 FHIR by
[Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/patient.html);
[Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/encounter.html);
[Condition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/condition.html),
[MedicationStatement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/medicationstatement.html),
[Observation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/observation.html)
resources, in accordance with the agreed FAIR4Health FHIR profiles.
These profiles also indicate the commonly agreed vocabularies to be
used.

For each set of resources generated by the FAIR4Health FAIRification
process a
[<span class="underline">Provenance</span>](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/provenance.html)
resource is created to document such a transformation; a
[<span class="underline">DocumentManifest</span>](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/documentmanifest.html)
resource is used to provide minimal documentation about data set
metadata including the licence of use and the
[<span class="underline">CapabilityStatement</span>](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021Mar/capabilitystatement.html)
is used to describe the capabilities offered by each site.

### Lessons learned

#### Metadata 

The practical application of the requirements about distinct,
identifiable and rich metadata is not so straightforward: this requires
a common understanding on what ‘metadata’ is (easy in principle, less in
practice) and an agreement on what is the minimal set of information
defining the metadata, decision that needs to take in consideration the
actual capability to provide and represent this minimal set.

In this initial phase the project has chosen to consider a minimal
starting set of information defined only for the project and study
level. No distinct subject level metadata have been implemented. Some of
these metadata have been published for human readability (case study -
project level) through the welcome page of the FAIR4Health portal;
others, enabling machine processing, have been also defined by using
FHIR Provenance, DocumentManifest resources. The latter represents study
level metadata and it has been published in GitHub.

On this topic a possible future improvement will be the increase of the
quantity of information provided as machine processable metadata,
considering the adoption of alternative resources such as the FHIR
Library or the Citation to better describe richer study level metadata
and their publication through FHIR API. Moreover, a better formalization
of Formalize what is intended as rich metadata in the associated FHIR
IG.

#### FHIR data, FAIR by design

Even though the Data Curation tool developed by the project to enable
the transformation of the raw data made available by the pilot sites
into FHIR resources, facilitated the realization of interoperable and
reusable data. Having native FHIR health data, designed to fulfill FAIR
principles, is the way to overcome all the experienced shortages,
potentially more and more critical when the domain of application will
be extended.

Added value of FHIR

Even if not all the capabilities offered by HL7 FHIR have been used at
this stage by the project, the adoption of HL7 FHIR gave a strong
contribution in terms of data reusability and interoperability. Allowing
to agree, formalize, share and adopt a common health data model for the
shared data within the project community.
