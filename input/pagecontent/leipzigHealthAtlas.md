The LHA \[<https://www.health-atlas.de/>\] is a research data management
repository for archiving and sharing data from scientific projects in
the biomedical and medical informatics fields. It includes data and
publications from research studies such as clinical trials,
epidemiological cohorts or registries. The LHA is technically based on
the [SEEK platform](https://seek4science.org/) and conceptually on
the[ ISA
model](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html).

The project leaders are responsible for assigning rights, but examples
exist with study data without access restrictions.
