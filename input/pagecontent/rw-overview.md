As described in the [Methodology](methodology.html) page, this guide has
been designed following an incremental, iterative and meet-in-the
-middle, considering different kinds of real-world scenarios as research
studies, publications, sharing of health data and others.

In this section a selected set of these real world scenarios is
summarized by providing for each of them:

1.  A short description of the scenario

2.  A summary of the the main findings and gaps that have been
    identified by performing a FAIRness assessment of the current status

3.  A description of where and how HL7 FHIR can be used to better
    support FAIR principles for that case

4.  Examples

The cases described in this guide are:

1.  The [FAIR4Health Project](FAIR4Health.html)

2.  [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](mimic.html) (MIMIC)

3.  [Immunology Database and Analysis Portal](immPort.html):

4.  [Non-Invasive Multimodal Foetal ECG-Doppler Dataset for Antenatal
    Cardiology Research](ninfea.html) NInFEA

5.  [Leipzig Health Atlas](leipzigHealthAtlas.html) (LHA)
