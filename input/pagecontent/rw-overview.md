This guide has been designed following an incremental,
iterative, and meet-in-the-middle approach, considering different
kinds of study cases as research studies, publications, sharing of
health data and others (see [Methodology](methodology.html) for more
details).

A selected set of these real-world cases (listed below) have been
summarized for exemplary purposes, providing for each of them the
following information:

1.  A short description of the scenario

2.  A summary of the main findings, gaps and lessons learned.

3.  A description of where and how HL7 FHIR can be or has been used to
    better support the FAIR principles.

The selected real-world cases are described in the following pages:

1.  The [FAIR4Health Project](FAIR4Health.html)

2.  The [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](mimic.html)
    (MIMIC)

3.  The [Immunology Database and Analysis Portal](immPort.html)

4.  The [Non-Invasive Multimodal Foetal ECG-Doppler Dataset for
    Antenatal Cardiology Research](ninfea.html) NInFEA

5.  The [Leipzig Health Atlas](leipzigHealthAtlas.html) (LHA)
