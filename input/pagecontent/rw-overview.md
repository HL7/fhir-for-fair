This guide has been designed following an incremental,
iterative, and meet-in-the-middle approach, considering different
kinds of study cases as research studies, publications, sharing of
health data and others (see [Methodology](methodology.html) for more
details).

In this section a selected set of these real-world cases have been
summarized:

1.  The [FAIR4Health Project](FAIR4Health.html)

2.  The [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](mimic.html)
    (MIMIC)

3.  The [Immunology Database and Analysis Portal](immPort.html)
    (ImmPort)

4.  The [Non-Invasive Multimodal Foetal ECG-Doppler Dataset for
    Antenatal Cardiology Research](ninfea.html) NInFEA

5.  The [Leipzig Health Atlas](leipzigHealthAtlas.html) (LHA)

6.  The [NFDI4Health consortia](NFDI4Health.html)

For each of them the following information has been provided:

1.  A short description of the scenario

2.  A summary of the main findings and gaps that have been identified by
    performing a FAIRness assessment; or

3.  The lesson learned by the implementation of the FAIR principles

4.  A description of where and how HL7 FHIR can be or has been used to
    better support the FAIR principles.
