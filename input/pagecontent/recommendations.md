### General Considerations

#### FAIR: a goal not a status

FAIRness is a goal not just than an achievable status:

1.  a continuous improvement incremental approach is required.

2.  Measurements, and then RDA indicators, are essential for evaluating
    achieved improvements.

3.  \<…\>

Do not pretend to implement everything since the beginning.

Know where you are (as is assessment) and what do you want to achieve.

Depending on the usage context, cost-effectiveness evaluation and your
goals, set up a consistent set of objectives either in term of:

  - RDA indicators to be fulfilled and realization maturity \<add
    example\>

  - HL7 FHIR implementation \< add example\>

***\< there is a very minimal set of indicators to be always
realized?\>***

Information on data provenance and licence could be included in the
metadata with a clear header rather than in comment.

### Findability

Findability covers a wide range of different expectations and users: not
of all of them are supposed to be realized by using HL7 FHIR based
technologies. For example, a human being makes a web searches to find
generically available data about COVID; a researcher knows that the XYZ
repository makes available Traumatic Brain Injury Research data and
cosnlut that site to search data set with specific characteristics.

Consider a multi-layered and hybrid approach: that is combination of
FHIR and non-FHI based technologies, enabling computable and human
findability. For example \<….\>
