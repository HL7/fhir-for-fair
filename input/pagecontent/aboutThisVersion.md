### What is in

1.  General guidance for FHIR implementation of the FAIR principles

2.  Providing guidance by examples by using some representative Real
    World cases

3.  Study level metadata representation. Conformance resources and
    examples for a set of reference cases

4.  Subject Level metadata. Addressing their representation in FHIR (it
    may be a distinct resource or not)

5.  Addressing general information about Copyright Licence management
    (metadata level)

### What is out

1.  Security protocols (e.g. Data is accessible through an access
    protocol that supports authentication and authorization)

2.  End point discovery (findability)

3.  Provenance (Metadata includes provenance information according to
    community-specific standards)

4.  Consent/Security Labels management

### Known/Open Issues

1.  Persistency of identifiers (DOI)

2.  Distinct and identifiable data and metadata FAIR data objects

3.  Low maturity of some of the Evidence based resources.

4.  "Metadata is guaranteed to remain available after data is no longer
    available" true if metadata are in distinct FHIR resources. 

5.  "FAIR-compliant vocabularies"
