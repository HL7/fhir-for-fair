### Scope

This guide aims to provide guidance on how HL7 FHIR can be used for
supporting **FAIR health data** implementation and assessment. This
project is intended to be the result of an active collaboration between
the RDA and HL7 communities.

### What does FAIR mean?

**FAIR** stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and
**R**eusable

The [**FAIR principles**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles) are
**a minimal set of community-agreed guiding principles** and
**practices** that allow both machines and humans to find, access,
interoperate and re-use research data.

The FAIR principles are well received in international community and
rapidly adopted by researchers.

More details about FAIR in the dedicated page.

### Goals

This project intends to contribute to the achievement of two main goal
by realizing a set of identified actions as summarized by the following
figure.

### IG Structure

Within the scope described above, this guide is attempting to also
satisfy these objectives:

1)  Facilitate the mutual understanding between the FAIR and the FHIR
    communities and enable a cooperative usage of the FHIR and FAIR
    paradigms, by providing cross-models mapping.

2)  Support the health data FAIRness assessment by using FHIR
    conformance resources.

To achieve these objectives this guide has been structured in two main
components:

1)  An informative guidance providing general guidelines on the
    cooperative usage of FHIR and FAIR

2)  A “true” FHIR IG providing set of FHIR conformance resources and
    examples that provide, for selected case(s), a practical example of
    how FAIRness can be realized and assessed by using HL7 FHIR.
